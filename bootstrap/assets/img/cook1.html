<h1>What Is a Line Cook?</h1>

<h2>What Is the Line?</h2>
<div class="right"><img src="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/blog/2022/9/two-chef-assistants-cooking-a-new-dish-in-a-restaurant-kitchen.jpg" alt="two chef assistants cooking a new dish in a restaurant kitchen"></div>
<p>You may be wondering what the "line" is and how line cooks got their name. A cook line is where most of the magic happens in a commercial kitchen. It’s a long, narrow space set up with all the hot-side equipment needed to cook menu items to order, usually deep fryers, charbroilers, a flat-top grill, a range top, and possibly a salamander or cheese-melter. You’ll also see microwaves and <a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/guide/723/chef-base-buying-guide.html" target="_blank"><strong>chef base refrigeration units</a></strong> for cold ingredients that line cooks need. This galley-like space is called the line because all the equipment is set up in a line, with a line cook assigned to each station. </p>
<h3>What’s It Like to Work on the Line?</h3>
<p>The line is a very active place during a shift. Ambient temperatures become extremely hot because of all the equipment running at once. Each line cook has to be aware of the space around them and all the potential hazards. <strong><a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/120/restaurant-positions-and-job-descriptions.html" target="_blank">Front-of-house staff members</a></strong> are usually not permitted to enter the line unless they are dropping off ingredients, clean cookware, or dinnerware. The reason for this is that the area is small and line cooks need all available space to prepare orders. </p>
<h2>Line Cook Duties</h2>
<div class="right"><img src="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/blog/2022/9/line-cook-making-dish-on-a-gas-stove.jpg" alt="line cook making dish on a gas stove"></div>
<p>Line cooks perform many tasks before, during, and after the shift has ended. Extra duties may be assigned, depending on how the kitchen manager divides up cleaning and prep tasks.
</p>
<h4>Before Service</h4>
<p>Line cooks must set up their stations with all the items they need for service. This includes ingredients and kitchen tools. If a cook is assigned to the fry station, they need clean fry baskets and utensils. A line cook assigned to the grill (charbroiler) needs tongs, seasoning shakers, and a stocked chef base with all the important menu items. If the nightly special is a New York strip steak with sauteed mushrooms and onions, the line cook makes sure there are strip steaks and toppings in the refrigeration unit. If ingredients are forgotten or miscounted, it results in wasted time spent running to the walk-in or freezer during service. Every second counts when you work on the line.</li>
<h4>During Service</h4>
<p>Each line cook is assigned to a cook station on the line. Throughout service, they man their station and cook all items that are ordered by guests. The fry station cook prepares all fried items. The grill cook prepares all grilled items like burgers, steaks, and chops. Depending on how complex the menu is, there might be a line cook assigned to the saute station, the sauce station, the seafood station, and/or the roast station. The salad station and dessert station are not considered part of the line because they usually don’t require hot-side equipment, but a line cook may be assigned to one of these stations as well.</p>
<h4>After Service</h4>
<p>As service starts to die down, each line cook is responsible for cleaning their station, setting it up for the next shift, or preparing it for closing. When a line cook closes out the shift, they need to put ingredients back in the right locations. All equipment needs to be cleaned according to daily requirements. For a fry cook, this could mean <a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/263/how-to-clean-a-deep-fryer.html" target="_blank"><strong>filtering or replacing the cooking oil</strong></a> in the deep fryers. If a line cook is working a breakfast shift and passing the station onto the night shift cook, it’s considered good etiquette to help stock their station. After stations are clean and stocked, a kitchen manager will check to make sure all tasks are done.</p>
<h4>Receiving Days</h4>
<p>Sometimes line cooks are assigned shifts on truck days, or receiving days. These are the days that food deliveries arrive at the restaurant. A line cook needs to be able to lift heavy boxes of ingredients and put them away in the right locations. They also need to check invoices, <a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/29/following-food-safety-temperatures.html" target="_blank"><strong>food temperatures</a></strong>, and the quality of items to make sure the shipment is correct and everything is food-safe. </li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Train a Line Cook</h2>
<p>Line cooks usually learn by shadowing a more experienced cook or by starting on an easy station. The salad station is considered one of the easiest stations. The fry station is another station that’s usually reserved for less experienced line cooks. From there, it’s possible to observe the head line cook and learn how all dishes are prepared. In a fine dining or traditional brigade-style kitchen, training is more rigorous and a new cook may have to prepare dishes as a test that they can perform the work.</p>
<p>One important aspect of line cook training that shouldn't be forgotten when <a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/119/how-to-hire-a-chef.html" target="_blank"><strong>hiring a new chef</a></strong> is food safety. All food handlers in the kitchen need to be familiar with <a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/48/preventing-cross-contamination.html" target="_blank"><strong>cross-contamination</a></strong> and how to prevent it. </p>
<h2>What Makes a Great Line Cook?</h2>
<div class="right"><img src="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/blog/2022/9/chef-cracking-an-egg-while-preparing-food-in-restaurant.jpg" alt="chef cracking an egg while preparing food in restaurant"></div>
<p>You don’t necessarily need a culinary degree to snag a job as a line cook at a restaurant. Many line cooks start as prep cooks or even dishwashers and work their way up the ladder. Besides experience with cooking and commercial kitchen equipment, these qualities will make someone stand out in this position:</p>
<ul class="noitalics">
<li style="font-size:13.5pt; padding-bottom:7px; margin:0;"><strong>Special requests and substitutions</strong> - When you prepare the same dish over and over, it becomes a habit to make it the same way every time. A great line cook will be on the lookout for any special requests like “no cheese” or “sauce on the side”. Preparing dishes exactly the way they are ordered eliminates do-over requests and saves time and money.</li>
<li style="font-size:13.5pt; padding-bottom:7px; margin:0;"><strong>Orders in the window</strong> - Some cooks think their job is complete when the dish is plated and sitting in the service window. A great line cook will pay attention to see if an order is sitting in the window too long, has become cold, or is wilting from the high heat. They take the initiative to remake or reheat a dish if it's needed.</li>
<li style="font-size:13.5pt; padding-bottom:7px; margin:0;"><strong>Focus on quality</strong> - In the middle of a busy rush, standards can be dropped pretty quickly. The best line cooks refuse to serve any dish that isn’t their best quality. This means paying attention to little details like burn marks, undercooked fries, and even smudges of sauce on a dinner plate.</li>
<li style="font-size:13.5pt; padding-bottom:7px; margin:0;"><strong>Communication with front-of-house</strong> - Sometimes it seems like the <a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/5/front-of-house-vs-back-of-house.html" target="_blank"><strong>back-of-house and front-of-house employees</a></strong> speak two different languages. Line cooks that excel at their job have great communication skills and partner with their server staff so everyone can succeed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prep Cook vs Line Cook</h2>
<p>The difference between a prep cook and a line cook is that a prep cook works on preparing ingredients ahead of time, while a line cook works during service to perform cooking tasks. The prep cook works off of a <a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/583/kitchen-prep-lists.html" target="_blank"><strong>par sheet</strong></a> to make sure the line cook has the ingredients they need. If it's estimated that the restaurant will sell 25 burgers that evening, the prep cook makes the burger patties, slices the tomatoes, and prepares any other burger toppings. When service begins, the line cook should have the right amount of ingredients for all burger orders that are placed. In small restaurants, it's common for line cooks to take turns doing prep work. </p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/353/types-of-restaurants.html" target="_blank"><strong>Different types of restaurants</a></strong> use a range of terms for their kitchen staff, but line cook is a common term in the industry for any cook who works on the line during service. If you see a job posting for a line cook, the position will most likely involve a variety of cooking tasks. Life as a line cook is fast-paced and requires attention to detail and great multi-tasking skills. It's a common entry point into the industry if you aspire to become a chef or own a restaurant one day.</p>

Many line cooks start as prep cooks or even dishwashers and work their way up the ladder. Besides experience with cooking and commercial kitchen equipment, these qualities will make someone stand out in this position:\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul class=\u0022noitalics\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cli style=\u0022font-size:13.5pt; padding-bottom:7px; margin:0;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpecial requests and substitutions\u003C/strong\u003E - When you prepare the same dish over and over, it becomes a habit to make it the same way every time. A great line cook will be on the lookout for any special requests like \u201Cno cheese\u201D or \u201Csauce on the side\u201D.

When service begins, the line cook should have the right amount of ingredients for all burger orders that are placed. In small restaurants, it\u0027s common for line cooks to take turns doing prep work. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Chr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/353/types-of-restaurants.html\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDifferent types of restaurants\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E use a range of terms for their kitchen staff, but line cook is a common term in the industry for any cook who works on the line during service. If you see a job posting for a line cook, the position will most likely involve a variety of cooking tasks. Life as a line cook is fast-paced and requires attention to detail and great multi-tasking skills.

Sometimes it seems like chefs and their kitchen staff have a language of their own. It\u0027s important to become familiar with kitchen slang because communication in a fast-paced restaurant is essential. Keep reading to brush up on some important slang terms.\r\n\r\nGlossary of Kitchen Slang Terms\r\nTo help you talk like a chef, we\u0027ve made a glossary of common kitchen slang, the meaning of each phrase, and how to use the terms in a sentence.\r\nA La Minute \r\nThe kitchen phrase a la minute is a French term that translates to at the minute or on the minute. It\u0027s used to describe a cooking method that relies on freshly prepared ingredients, but it\u0027s also used to signify a dish or condiment must be made to order.\r\nExample: That sauce is made a la minute! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Day \r\nIn chef slang, the expression all day  is used to indicate the total number of orders needed. As tickets come in, a chef will shout out the orders followed by all day. If there are three orders of fries on one ticket and four orders of fries on another ticket, there are seven orders of fries all day.  \r\nExample: We have ten orders of artichoke dip and eight fries all day.\r\n\r\nBehind\r\nTo avoid collisions with other staff members scurrying around a busy kitchen, it\u0027s considered polite to clearly say, \u0022Behind,\u0022 as you pass behind another person. This is even more important if you are carrying a full tray of food, a hot pan, or a rack of glassware. You might also hear variations of this expression like \u0022Sharp behind,\u0022 or \u0022Hot behind,\u0022 to indicate someone is passing by carrying an object could harm another staff member. \r\nExample: Don\u0027t step back, I\u0027m behind.\r\n\r\nChit \r\nWhen servers key in an order on the POS system, the corresponding ticket that prints out on the chef\u0027s line is called a chit.\r\nExample: The shift just started and the rail is already filled with chits.\r\n\r\nCovers\r\nIn kitchen slang, covers are the number of people, or heads, that are being served in the dining room. Restaurant managers count the number of covers that are served in one shift to determine what future shifts will be like. They can also make projections on how much customers will spend based on previous sales per cover. \r\nExample: If we get the same covers as last Friday, it\u0027s going to be a busy night.\r\n\r\nDead Plate\r\nA dead plate is a dish of food that is unservable, either because a customer sent it back or because it was prepared incorrectly. Dead plates are usually considered fair game for servers or cooks to eat, but it depends on the restaurant\u0027s policy. \r\nExample: I hope that\u0027s a dead plate because I\u0027ve seen two people grab fries off of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDying on the Pass \r\nA dish that is dying on the pass is sitting for too long in the window and is at the risk of becoming unservable. \r\nExample: Can someone get this order out now? It\u0027s dying on the pass.\r\n\r\nDeuce \r\n In restaurant lingo, a dining room table that seats two people is nicknamed a deuce.\r\nExample: So far, we only have a couple deuces on the floor. It might be a slow night.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpo \r\nExpo is the shortened term for expeditor, or the person in charge of organizing and traying up food before it\u0027s taken out to the dining room. An expo makes sure each dish is correct and then hands off orders to the food runner or server. This role is often rotated between servers, hosts, and managers. The area where the expo works is also sometimes called the expo window.\r\nExample: We\u0027re definitely going to need an expo tonight. We\u0027re fully booked!\r\n\r\nFire \r\nWhen servers key an order into the POS system and send it to the kitchen, they\u0027ve just fired the order. Sometimes they will wait to fire the entrees until the appetizers have been served to help with pacing of the meal. It\u0027s also considered bad etiquette to fire too many orders at once.\r\nExample: I\u0027m firing table five\u0027s apps right now!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlash\r\nIf a dish needs to be reheated quickly, the cooks flash it with high heat on the charbroiler or in the salamander. This usually comes as a request from a server or expo when a dish is undercooked or has been sitting in the window too long.\r\nExample: This plate looks cold! Can you flash it for me?\r\n\r\nFloor \r\nThe dining room is referred to as the floor. When anyone from the kitchen walks out onto the floor, their uniforms should be clean and they should act appropriately in the sight of guests. Managers will do rounds and walk the floor several times during a shift to check on customers.\r\nExample: Does everyone on the floor look happy?\r\n\r\nHeard / Heard That\r\nWhen the chef is calling out tickets, the cooking staff will indicate they got their orders by saying \u0022Heard!\u0022 or \u0022Heard that!\u0022 \r\nExample: Two orders of broccoli? Heard that, chef!\r\n\r\nIn the Weeds / Weeded\r\nThe phrase in the weeds is kitchen lingo that means someone is really busy and having a hard time keeping up. It\u0027s a dreaded position to be in but happens to everyone, especially if the kitchen is understaffed on a busy night.\r\nExample: I\u0027m really in the weeds over here! Can someone come help me? \r\n\r\nKill It \r\nIn restaurant jargon, kill it means to cook something extra well done. Killing a steak or a chicken breast means to overcook it.\r\n\r\nExample: Make sure you kill this steak because they want it extra well.\r\n\r\n\r\nLow Boy \r\n\r\nAn undercounter refrigerator is nicknamed a low boy. This could be any type of refrigeration unit that stands waist high. Low boys are convenient for chefs because they keep chilled ingredients close at hand when they are on the line. \r\nExample: Can you hand me some cheese slices from the low boy?\r\n\r\nMise \r\n\r\nThe word mise, pronounced meez, is a shortened version of the phrase mise en place. Mise en place translates to everything in its place. Cooks will use mise to indicate they have all the prep work for each dish completed. \r\nExample: Everything is mised and I\u0027m ready for dinner service.\r\n\r\nOn Deck \r\nUsing the phrase on deck is just like saying, \u0022This order is coming up!\u0022 Cooks might call out new tickets and let the line know what is on deck. They\u0027ll also give servers a heads up if their orders are on deck, or coming out soon.\r\nExample: Don\u0027t leave the kitchen, your order is on deck!\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Fly \r\nWhen you need an order on the fly, you need it yesterday. If a server forgot to fire an order and suddenly realizes their table has been waiting 20 minutes, they will request an order on the fly.\r\nExample: Table three needs an order of onion rings on the fly!\r\n\r\nOn the Line \r\nThe line refers to the area behind the kitchen window where chefs do most of the cooking during service. A typical line includes a walkway where the chefs stand, a grouping of cooking equipment behind them, and a work space in front of them where they plate dishes. \r\nExample: Who\u0027s working on the line tonight?\r\n\r\nPass \r\nThe pass is the area in front of the cooking line where orders are placed for servers to pick up. It can also be referred to as the window, as many kitchens have an actual window between the line and the expo area.\r\nExample: Your order\u0027s sitting on the pass.\r\n\r\nThe Rail / Board \r\nLine cooks use the rail or board to hold all of their incoming tickets. It\u0027s a strip of metal above the food window that holds tickets in place so anyone on the line can clearly read the orders. Clearing the rail means that all the tickets have been completed.\r\nExample: Let\u0027s clear this rail and get the orders out!\r\n\r\nRun the Dish \r\nRun the dish means to deliver a dish to a table. Many times, whoever is available in the kitchen when the order is on deck will be asked to run the dish.\r\nExample: Can you run this dish to table eight?\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning the Pass \r\nThe cook in charge of calling out the tickets and making sure each order is complete is running the pass. It\u0027s important to have a point person on the line who can accurately call out orders to the other line cooks. The chef running the pass also works with the expo to make sure each dish is plated correctly.\r\nExample: She always keeps her cool when she\u0027s running the pass.\r\n\r\nSOS \r\nIn chef lingo, SOS is an acronym for sauce on the side. It can be used when keying in orders or as a spoken request.\r\nExample: Can I get that order made SOS?\r\n\r\nStretch It \r\nStretch it is chef slang for making ingredients last as long as possible.\r\nExample: Can you stretch that sauce for one more dish?\r\n\r\nWaxing a Table \r\nIf a server is waxing a table, they are giving that table special treatment. This VIP service is usually reserved for important guests like the restaurant owner\u0027s family or regular customers that are known to be big tippers.   \r\nExample: There\u0027s a restaurant critic at table three so I need you to wax the table a little bit.\r\n\r\nTwo Top / Three Top \r\nIn restaurant slang, dining room tables are identified by how many guests they can accommodate. A table that seats two is called a two top. A table that seats three is called a three top. \r\nExample: I have an open six top in my section.\r\n\r\n\r\n86 \r\nWhen a menu item has completely run out, chefs will say the dish is 86ed. It\u0027s important for the kitchen staff  to communicate this to servers as soon as possible so that no more orders are placed for the item. \r\nExample: Spread the word, the special is 86ed already.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew kitchen slang pops up all the time as chefs find new ways to communicate with each other. We\u0027ve decoded some of the most common kitchen phrases used by cooks to help you integrate into restaurant culture. Understanding these terms will help you to be successful in whatever position you hold, whether you\u0027re a restaurant owner, chef, or server.","link":"/article/511/kitchen-slang-phrases.html"},{"sortOrder":0,"id":0,"header":"How to Become a Chef ","imagePath":"/images/articles/thumbnails/130/howtobecomeachef_articleheader_5.jpg","content":"The foodservice industry is one of the largest and most diverse industries in the United States. It\u0027s also one of the fastest growing, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that the restaurant industry would grow by 7% between 2014 and 2024. The restaurant industry has many unique perks that make it appealing to potential employees, such as the ability to express yourself creatively at work and the chance to move anywhere around the world and know there are jobs available. So, if you\u0027re considering becoming a chef but don\u0027t know where to begin, we\u0027ll explain the educational requirements to become a chef, whether or not you need a culinary school education, and some potential career paths for chefs.\r\n\r\nRequirements to Become a Chef\r\n\r\nIf you\u0027ve decided that you want to become a chef and work in foodservice as a career, you may be wondering if there are any educational requirements and how long it\u0027ll take to get training and become a competent chef. We\u0027ll break down the time commitment, monetary investment, and educational requirements to become a chef:\r\n\r\nTime Commitment to Become a Chef: If you\u0027re aiming to go to culinary school, it takes two years to obtain an associate\u0027s degree and four years for a bachelor\u0027s degree. \r\nChef Education Requirements: Some restaurants require a minimum of a high school diploma or GED equivalent. It\u0027s possible to find employment without no culinary school education, but it may be more difficult to find a job in upscale settings.\r\nHow Much Does Culinary School Cost: The price of culinary school will vary by the reputation of the school, type of classes offered, and length of the programs, but you can expect that culinary school will cost around the same as traditional college. Your culinary school tuition could be anywhere from $10,000 per year to $35,000, for example.\r\n\r\n\r\nCulinary School Vs. Experience\r\n\r\nThere are two main paths that you can take to become a chef: a formal education at a culinary school or learning through experience working in a kitchen. Both options have their pros and cons, which we\u0027ll explore further.\r\n\r\nShould You Go to Culinary School?\r\n\r\nGoing to culinary school is an excellent option for many aspiring chefs, and it\u0027s a great choice if you have the time and the money, but it may not be accessible to everyone. Here are some of the benefits of going to culinary school:\r\nPros of Going to Culinary School\r\n\r\nAttending school teaches you the correct techniques, so you don\u0027t develop any bad habits in the kitchen.\r\nYour professors are a valuable resource, and they can potentially help you make connections and find a job after you\u0027ve graduated.\r\nHaving a culinary school background can help you hone your palate and learn which flavors complement each other. \r\nGoing to school will expose you to many different flavors, ingredients, and cooking styles, which gives you versatility when it comes to choosing what style of food you want to cook.\r\nSome culinary schools help their students find internships and employment opportunities, opening doors that may not be otherwise available.\r\n\r\nCons of Going to Culinary School\r\nWhile culinary school is a great way to start becoming a chef, there are some negatives as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttending culinary school is a major time commitment, and not everyone will be able to take several years off to study full time.\r\nIt can be very expensive, and it may require you to take out a lot of loans.\r\nIt can be difficult to pay off culinary school loans working at entry-level foodservice jobs. \r\n\r\n\r\nBecoming a Chef Through Work Experience\r\nThe other option to become a chef is to learn the skills through working in restaurants. Similar to going to culinary school, this route has its own pros and cons. Here are some of the major benefits of learning to become a chef through experience: \r\n\r\nPros of Learning Through Work Experience\r\n\r\nYou are making money while you\u0027re learning cooking skills.\r\nYou\u0027re getting first-hand experience in the kitchen, which can tell you if you can handle the high-stress environment. Additionally, having kitchen experience can give you an upper hand over job applicants that only have a culinary school background.\r\nMany chefs are willing to mentor line cooks that are interested in the industry, so you can learn the craft of cooking.\r\nWorking in the restaurant industry is a great way to network, which can help you find jobs in the future.\r\n\r\nCons of Learning Through Work Experience\r\nThere are also some downsides to becoming a chef through work experience, though:\r\n\r\n\r\nLearning to be a chef via experience won\u0027t give you access to the same contacts that you would get if you had gone to culinary school.\r\nBecause you\u0027re not learning from a professional teacher, you may develop some bad kitchen habits, such as holding your knife the wrong way or using incorrect cutting techniques.\r\nYou may have difficulty competing for higher level jobs against applicants that have work experience and a culinary school degree.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to choosing between culinary school and learning through experience, there isn\u0027t an obvious winner. Instead, you need to decide which option suits your individual needs and situation. Additionally, if you\u0027re stuck between the two, you can always work in restaurants for several years to save up some money before attending culinary school.\r\n\r\nCareers in the Restaurant Industry\r\nThere are many different career paths you can take in the restaurant industry depending on your interests and strengths. If you\u0027re interested in detailed and meticulous work, you can pursue becoming a pastry chef or opening your own bakery. Or, if you\u0027re interested in working in different locations and designing unique menus, you can look into working in catering. Here we\u0027ll lay out some common careers in the restaurant industry and what route you need to take to attain that goal.\r\n\r\nHow to Become an Executive Chef:\r\nThe executive chef is the person in charge of the kitchen. They oversee all of the other stations in the kitchen and are usually responsible for designing the menu. For many chefs, this position is the end goal, so how do you become an executive chef?\r\n\r\nTo become an executive chef, you need many years of experience working in kitchens. Additionally, if you\u0027re going to be designing a menu and creating new recipes, you may have to prove to the owners that you can create tasty dishes that are in line with the establishment\u0027s brand and style. Executive chefs also need to have excellent time management, administrative, and managerial skills.\r\n\r\nHow to Become a Personal Chef\r\nPrivate chefs bring the excitement of going out to eat to someone\u0027s home kitchen. This career is great for aspiring chefs with versatile cooking skills and great networking abilities. To become a private chef, your first step should be to create a private business for tax purposes. Then, you can begin marketing yourself online or through word-of-mouth and searching for clients. \r\n\r\nIf you\u0027re unsure if becoming a personal chef is right for you, here are a few skills that you\u0027ll need to utilize to succeed:\r\n\r\n\r\nHave excellent people skills. To succeed as a personal chef, you need to be able to connect with your clients and create a warm and inviting atmosphere.\r\nMaster many different cooking styles. Private chefs are expected to create many different dishes, so being able to cook various types of food is essential. \r\nAble to handle long hours. Working as a personal chef will require you to be up early to prepare breakfast and stay late until all of the dishes are cleaned after dinner. \r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Become a Pastry Chef\r\nBecoming a pastry chef requires a lot of specialized training and experience.

Kitchen Slang: How to Talk Like a Chef
</h3>
<p class="related-resources__text">
If you&#x27;re training to become a chef in a commercial kitchen, you may hear some restaurant lingo that is completely new to you. Sometimes it seems like chefs and their kitchen staff have a language of their own. It&#x27;s important to become familiar with kitchen slang because communication in a fast-paced restaurant is essential. Keep reading to brush up on some important slang terms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Glossary of Kitchen Slang Terms&#xD;&#xA;To help you talk like a chef, we&#x27;ve made a glossary of common kitchen slang, the meaning of each phrase, and how to use the terms in a sentence.&#xD;&#xA;A La Minute &#xD;&#xA;The kitchen phrase a la minute is a French term that translates to at the minute or on the minute. It&#x27;s used to describe a cooking method that relies on freshly prepared ingredients, but it&#x27;s also used to signify a dish or condiment must be made to order.&#xD;&#xA;Example: That sauce is made a la minute! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All Day &#xD;&#xA;In chef slang, the expression all day is used to indicate the total number of orders needed. As tickets come in, a chef will shout out the orders followed by all day. If there are three orders of fries on one ticket and four orders of fries on another ticket, there are seven orders of fries all day. &#xD;&#xA;Example: We have ten orders of artichoke dip and eight fries all day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Behind&#xD;&#xA;To avoid collisions with other staff members scurrying around a busy kitchen, it&#x27;s considered polite to clearly say, &quot;Behind,&quot; as you pass behind another person. This is even more important if you are carrying a full tray of food, a hot pan, or a rack of glassware. You might also hear variations of this expression like &quot;Sharp behind,&quot; or &quot;Hot behind,&quot; to indicate someone is passing by carrying an object could harm another staff member. &#xD;&#xA;Example: Don&#x27;t step back, I&#x27;m behind.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Chit &#xD;&#xA;When servers key in an order on the POS system, the corresponding ticket that prints out on the chef&#x27;s line is called a chit.&#xD;&#xA;Example: The shift just started and the rail is already filled with chits.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Covers&#xD;&#xA;In kitchen slang, covers are the number of people, or heads, that are being served in the dining room. Restaurant managers count the number of covers that are served in one shift to determine what future shifts will be like. They can also make projections on how much customers will spend based on previous sales per cover. &#xD;&#xA;Example: If we get the same covers as last Friday, it&#x27;s going to be a busy night.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Dead Plate&#xD;&#xA;A dead plate is a dish of food that is unservable, either because a customer sent it back or because it was prepared incorrectly. Dead plates are usually considered fair game for servers or cooks to eat, but it depends on the restaurant&#x27;s policy. &#xD;&#xA;Example: I hope that&#x27;s a dead plate because I&#x27;ve seen two people grab fries off of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Dying on the Pass &#xD;&#xA;A dish that is dying on the pass is sitting for too long in the window and is at the risk of becoming unservable. &#xD;&#xA;Example: Can someone get this order out now? It&#x27;s dying on the pass.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Deuce &#xD;&#xA; In restaurant lingo, a dining room table that seats two people is nicknamed a deuce.&#xD;&#xA;Example: So far, we only have a couple deuces on the floor. It might be a slow night.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Expo &#xD;&#xA;Expo is the shortened term for expeditor, or the person in charge of organizing and traying up food before it&#x27;s taken out to the dining room. An expo makes sure each dish is correct and then hands off orders to the food runner or server. This role is often rotated between servers, hosts, and managers. The area where the expo works is also sometimes called the expo window.&#xD;&#xA;Example: We&#x27;re definitely going to need an expo tonight. We&#x27;re fully booked!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fire &#xD;&#xA;When servers key an order into the POS system and send it to the kitchen, they&#x27;ve just fired the order. Sometimes they will wait to fire the entrees until the appetizers have been served to help with pacing of the meal. It&#x27;s also considered bad etiquette to fire too many orders at once.&#xD;&#xA;Example: I&#x27;m firing table five&#x27;s apps right now!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Flash&#xD;&#xA;If a dish needs to be reheated quickly, the cooks flash it with high heat on the charbroiler or in the salamander. This usually comes as a request from a server or expo when a dish is undercooked or has been sitting in the window too long.&#xD;&#xA;Example: This plate looks cold! Can you flash it for me?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Floor &#xD;&#xA;The dining room is referred to as the floor. When anyone from the kitchen walks out onto the floor, their uniforms should be clean and they should act appropriately in the sight of guests. Managers will do rounds and walk the floor several times during a shift to check on customers.&#xD;&#xA;Example: Does everyone on the floor look happy?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Heard / Heard That&#xD;&#xA;When the chef is calling out tickets, the cooking staff will indicate they got their orders by saying &quot;Heard!&quot; or &quot;Heard that!&quot; &#xD;&#xA;Example: Two orders of broccoli? Heard that, chef!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the Weeds / Weeded&#xD;&#xA;The phrase in the weeds is kitchen lingo that means someone is really busy and having a hard time keeping up. It&#x27;s a dreaded position to be in but happens to everyone, especially if the kitchen is understaffed on a busy night.&#xD;&#xA;Example: I&#x27;m really in the weeds over here! Can someone come help me? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Kill It &#xD;&#xA;In restaurant jargon, kill it means to cook something extra well done. Killing a steak or a chicken breast means to overcook it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Example: Make sure you kill this steak because they want it extra well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Low Boy &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An undercounter refrigerator is nicknamed a low boy. This could be any type of refrigeration unit that stands waist high. Low boys are convenient for chefs because they keep chilled ingredients close at hand when they are on the line. &#xD;&#xA;Example: Can you hand me some cheese slices from the low boy?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mise &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The word mise, pronounced meez, is a shortened version of the phrase mise en place. Mise en place translates to everything in its place. Cooks will use mise to indicate they have all the prep work for each dish completed. &#xD;&#xA;Example: Everything is mised and I&#x27;m ready for dinner service.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On Deck &#xD;&#xA;Using the phrase on deck is just like saying, &quot;This order is coming up!&quot; Cooks might call out new tickets and let the line know what is on deck. They&#x27;ll also give servers a heads up if their orders are on deck, or coming out soon.&#xD;&#xA;Example: Don&#x27;t leave the kitchen, your order is on deck!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the Fly &#xD;&#xA;When you need an order on the fly, you need it yesterday. If a server forgot to fire an order and suddenly realizes their table has been waiting 20 minutes, they will request an order on the fly.&#xD;&#xA;Example: Table three needs an order of onion rings on the fly!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the Line &#xD;&#xA;The line refers to the area behind the kitchen window where chefs do most of the cooking during service. A typical line includes a walkway where the chefs stand, a grouping of cooking equipment behind them, and a work space in front of them where they plate dishes. &#xD;&#xA;Example: Who&#x27;s working on the line tonight?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pass &#xD;&#xA;The pass is the area in front of the cooking line where orders are placed for servers to pick up. It can also be referred to as the window, as many kitchens have an actual window between the line and the expo area.&#xD;&#xA;Example: Your order&#x27;s sitting on the pass.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Rail / Board &#xD;&#xA;Line cooks use the rail or board to hold all of their incoming tickets. It&#x27;s a strip of metal above the food window that holds tickets in place so anyone on the line can clearly read the orders. Clearing the rail means that all the tickets have been completed.&#xD;&#xA;Example: Let&#x27;s clear this rail and get the orders out!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Run the Dish &#xD;&#xA;Run the dish means to deliver a dish to a table. Many times, whoever is available in the kitchen when the order is on deck will be asked to run the dish.&#xD;&#xA;Example: Can you run this dish to table eight?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Running the Pass &#xD;&#xA;The cook in charge of calling out the tickets and making sure each order is complete is running the pass. It&#x27;s important to have a point person on the line who can accurately call out orders to the other line cooks. The chef running the pass also works with the expo to make sure each dish is plated correctly.&#xD;&#xA;Example: She always keeps her cool when she&#x27;s running the pass.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;SOS &#xD;&#xA;In chef lingo, SOS is an acronym for sauce on the side. It can be used when keying in orders or as a spoken request.&#xD;&#xA;Example: Can I get that order made SOS?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Stretch It &#xD;&#xA;Stretch it is chef slang for making ingredients last as long as possible.&#xD;&#xA;Example: Can you stretch that sauce for one more dish?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Waxing a Table &#xD;&#xA;If a server is waxing a table, they are giving that table special treatment. This VIP service is usually reserved for important guests like the restaurant owner&#x27;s family or regular customers that are known to be big tippers. &#xD;&#xA;Example: There&#x27;s a restaurant critic at table three so I need you to wax the table a little bit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Two Top / Three Top &#xD;&#xA;In restaurant slang, dining room tables are identified by how many guests they can accommodate. A table that seats two is called a two top. A table that seats three is called a three top. &#xD;&#xA;Example: I have an open six top in my section.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;86 &#xD;&#xA;When a menu item has completely run out, chefs will say the dish is 86ed. It&#x27;s important for the kitchen staff to communicate this to servers as soon as possible so that no more orders are placed for the item. &#xD;&#xA;Example: Spread the word, the special is 86ed already.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;New kitchen slang pops up all the time as chefs find new ways to communicate with each other. We&#x27;ve decoded some of the most common kitchen phrases used by cooks to help you integrate into restaurant culture. Understanding these terms will help you to be successful in whatever position you hold, whether you&#x27;re a restaurant owner, chef, or server.

How to Become a Chef
</h3>
<p class="related-resources__text">
The foodservice industry is one of the largest and most diverse industries in the United States. It&#x27;s also one of the fastest growing, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that the restaurant industry would grow by 7% between 2014 and 2024. The restaurant industry has many unique perks that make it appealing to potential employees, such as the ability to express yourself creatively at work and the chance to move anywhere around the world and know there are jobs available. So, if you&#x27;re considering becoming a chef but don&#x27;t know where to begin, we&#x27;ll explain the educational requirements to become a chef, whether or not you need a culinary school education, and some potential career paths for chefs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Requirements to Become a Chef&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you&#x27;ve decided that you want to become a chef and work in foodservice as a career, you may be wondering if there are any educational requirements and how long it&#x27;ll take to get training and become a competent chef. We&#x27;ll break down the time commitment, monetary investment, and educational requirements to become a chef:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Time Commitment to Become a Chef: If you&#x27;re aiming to go to culinary school, it takes two years to obtain an associate&#x27;s degree and four years for a bachelor&#x27;s degree. &#xD;&#xA;Chef Education Requirements: Some restaurants require a minimum of a high school diploma or GED equivalent. It&#x27;s possible to find employment without no culinary school education, but it may be more difficult to find a job in upscale settings.&#xD;&#xA;How Much Does Culinary School Cost: The price of culinary school will vary by the reputation of the school, type of classes offered, and length of the programs, but you can expect that culinary school will cost around the same as traditional college. Your culinary school tuition could be anywhere from $10,000 per year to $35,000, for example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Culinary School Vs. Experience&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two main paths that you can take to become a chef: a formal education at a culinary school or learning through experience working in a kitchen. Both options have their pros and cons, which we&#x27;ll explore further.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Should You Go to Culinary School?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Going to culinary school is an excellent option for many aspiring chefs, and it&#x27;s a great choice if you have the time and the money, but it may not be accessible to everyone. Here are some of the benefits of going to culinary school:&#xD;&#xA;Pros of Going to Culinary School&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Attending school teaches you the correct techniques, so you don&#x27;t develop any bad habits in the kitchen.&#xD;&#xA;Your professors are a valuable resource, and they can potentially help you make connections and find a job after you&#x27;ve graduated.&#xD;&#xA;Having a culinary school background can help you hone your palate and learn which flavors complement each other. &#xD;&#xA;Going to school will expose you to many different flavors, ingredients, and cooking styles, which gives you versatility when it comes to choosing what style of food you want to cook.&#xD;&#xA;Some culinary schools help their students find internships and employment opportunities, opening doors that may not be otherwise available.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cons of Going to Culinary School&#xD;&#xA;While culinary school is a great way to start becoming a chef, there are some negatives as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Attending culinary school is a major time commitment, and not everyone will be able to take several years off to study full time.&#xD;&#xA;It can be very expensive, and it may require you to take out a lot of loans.&#xD;&#xA;It can be difficult to pay off culinary school loans working at entry-level foodservice jobs. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Becoming a Chef Through Work Experience&#xD;&#xA;The other option to become a chef is to learn the skills through working in restaurants. Similar to going to culinary school, this route has its own pros and cons. Here are some of the major benefits of learning to become a chef through experience: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pros of Learning Through Work Experience&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You are making money while you&#x27;re learning cooking skills.&#xD;&#xA;You&#x27;re getting first-hand experience in the kitchen, which can tell you if you can handle the high-stress environment. Additionally, having kitchen experience can give you an upper hand over job applicants that only have a culinary school background.&#xD;&#xA;Many chefs are willing to mentor line cooks that are interested in the industry, so you can learn the craft of cooking.&#xD;&#xA;Working in the restaurant industry is a great way to network, which can help you find jobs in the future.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cons of Learning Through Work Experience&#xD;&#xA;There are also some downsides to becoming a chef through work experience, though:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Learning to be a chef via experience won&#x27;t give you access to the same contacts that you would get if you had gone to culinary school.&#xD;&#xA;Because you&#x27;re not learning from a professional teacher, you may develop some bad kitchen habits, such as holding your knife the wrong way or using incorrect cutting techniques.&#xD;&#xA;You may have difficulty competing for higher level jobs against applicants that have work experience and a culinary school degree.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When it comes to choosing between culinary school and learning through experience, there isn&#x27;t an obvious winner. Instead, you need to decide which option suits your individual needs and situation. Additionally, if you&#x27;re stuck between the two, you can always work in restaurants for several years to save up some money before attending culinary school.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Careers in the Restaurant Industry&#xD;&#xA;There are many different career paths you can take in the restaurant industry depending on your interests and strengths. If you&#x27;re interested in detailed and meticulous work, you can pursue becoming a pastry chef or opening your own bakery. Or, if you&#x27;re interested in working in different locations and designing unique menus, you can look into working in catering. Here we&#x27;ll lay out some common careers in the restaurant industry and what route you need to take to attain that goal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How to Become an Executive Chef:&#xD;&#xA;The executive chef is the person in charge of the kitchen. They oversee all of the other stations in the kitchen and are usually responsible for designing the menu. For many chefs, this position is the end goal, so how do you become an executive chef?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To become an executive chef, you need many years of experience working in kitchens. Additionally, if you&#x27;re going to be designing a menu and creating new recipes, you may have to prove to the owners that you can create tasty dishes that are in line with the establishment&#x27;s brand and style. Executive chefs also need to have excellent time management, administrative, and managerial skills.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How to Become a Personal Chef&#xD;&#xA;Private chefs bring the excitement of going out to eat to someone&#x27;s home kitchen. This career is great for aspiring chefs with versatile cooking skills and great networking abilities. To become a private chef, your first step should be to create a private business for tax purposes. Then, you can begin marketing yourself online or through word-of-mouth and searching for clients. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you&#x27;re unsure if becoming a personal chef is right for you, here are a few skills that you&#x27;ll need to utilize to succeed:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Have excellent people skills. To succeed as a personal chef, you need to be able to connect with your clients and create a warm and inviting atmosphere.&#xD;&#xA;Master many different cooking styles. Private chefs are expected to create many different dishes, so being able to cook various types of food is essential. &#xD;&#xA;Able to handle long hours. Working as a personal chef will require you to be up early to prepare breakfast and stay late until all of the dishes are cleaned after dinner. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How to Become a Pastry Chef&#xD;&#xA;Becoming a pastry chef requires a lot of specialized training and experience. So, if you&#x27;ve considering a career as a pastry chef or in baking, it&#x27;s best to attend a culinary school that has a pastry program. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are other ways to enter the baking and pastry industry, though. One other alternative that is an exciting option for people who want to get into the foodservice industry is to open a home bakery. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Working in foodservice is an immensely rewarding career path that allows you to express your creativity and gives you a lot of freedom to take your career in the direction that you want. There are many different ways that you can approach a career as a chef as well, whether it be culinary school or work experience, allowing you to find the path that works best for you individually.
